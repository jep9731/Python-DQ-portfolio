    "# Guided Project: Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, however, we put everything together to contribute to the development of a mobile app that is meant to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018 (we'll come back to this).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying the concepts we learned in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario."

    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first screen, we saw our goal is to write code that can enable users to answer probability questions about playing the lottery. Throughout the project, we'll need to calculate repeatedly probabilities and combinations. As a consequence, we'll start by writing two functions that we'll use often:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that calculates factorials; and\n",
    "* A function that calculates combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate factorials, this is the formula we learned we need to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "n! = n × (n−1) × (n−2) × ... × 2 × 1\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. The drawing is done without replacement, which means once a number is drawn, it's not put back in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the number of combinations when we're sampling without replacement and taking only k objects from a group of n objects, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "nCk = n!/k!(n−k)!\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function named `factorial()` which takes as input a number `n` and computes the factorial of that number `n`. \n",
    "2. Write a function named `combinations()` which takes in two inputs (`n` and `k`) and outputs the number of combinations when we're taking only *k* objects from a group of *n* objects."

    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn. If a player has a ticket with the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, he only wins the big prize if the numbers drawn are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}. If only one number differs, he doesn't win.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we want players to be able to calculate the probability of winning the big prize with the various numbers they play on a single ticket (for each ticket a player chooses six numbers out of 49). So, we'll start by building a function that calculates the probability of winning the big prize for any given ticket.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function named `one_ticket_probability()`, which takes in a list of six unique numbers and prints the probability of winning in a way that's easy to understand.\n",
    "    * Start by calculating the total number of possible outcomes — this is total number of combinations for a six-number lottery ticket. There are 49 possible numbers, and six numbers are sampled without replacement. Use the `combinations()` function you wrote in the previous screen.\n",
    "    * The user inputs just one combination, which means the number of successful outcomes is 1.\n",
    "    * Use the number of successful outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes to calculate the probability for one ticket.\n",
    "    * The function should print the probability in a way that's easy to understand. It's up to you what you choose, but here are a few suggestions:\n",
    "        * Print the probability as a percentage.\n",
    "        * Use the [`str.format()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) to make the printed message more personalized with respect to what the user inputs.\n",

    "Lottery addicts usually play more than one ticket on a single drawing, thinking that this might increase their chances of winning significantly. Our purpose is to help them better estimate their chances of winning — on this screen, we're going to write a function that will allow the users to calculate the chances of winning for any number of different tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked with the engineering team and they gave us the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The user will input the number of different tickets they want to play (without inputting the specific combinations they intend to play).\n",
    "* Our function will see an integer between 1 and 13,983,816 (the maximum number of different tickets).\n",
    "* The function should print information about the probability of winning the big prize depending on the number of different tickets played.\n",

    "    * Start by calculating the total number of possible outcomes — this is total number of combinations for a six-number lottery ticket. There are 49 total numbers, and six numbers are sampled without replacement. Use the `combinations()` function you wrote in a previous screen.\n",
    "    * The number of successful outcomes is given by the number of tickets the user intends to play.\n",
    "    * Use the number of successful outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes to calculate the probability for the number of tickets inputted. \n",
    "    * The function should print the probability in a way that's easy to understand. It's up to you what you choose, but here are a few suggestions:\n",
    "        * Print the probability as a percentage.\n",
    "        * Use the [`str.format()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) to make the printed message more personalized with respect to what the user inputs.\n",
    "2. Test your function using the following inputs: `[1, 10, 100, 10000, 1000000, 6991908, 13983816]`."

    "\n",

    "2. What is the probability of having at least five winning numbers?\n",
